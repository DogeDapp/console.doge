# Console.doge
Makes pretty colors and says stuff in the console in like one browser, probably Chrome. So there's that.

_What is it good for? Absolutely nothing._

## How to use

```
<script src="console.doge.min.js"></script>
<script>
console.doge();
console.doge( 'such console' );
console.doge( {
  text: 'so pretty',
  fontcolor: 'blue',
  fontsize: '300px'
} );
</script>
```

## FAQ

### Should I use this in production?
No. IE hates your console and will probably break your entire web site.

### Why did you do this?
Because I love you.
